ClaferChocoIG
===========

v0.3.5.15-01-2014

A backend for [ClaferIDE](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferIDE) that uses [ChocoSolver](https://github.com/gsdlab/chocosolver) to generate instances.
This project is a wrapper that invokes ChocoSolver in a proper way and produces the output in the same format as ClaferIG does.

Contributors
------------

* [Alexandr Murashkin](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/amurashk), MMath Candidate. Main developer.
* [Jimmy Liang](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/jliang), MSc. Candidate. Ports to Java 1.7 and Choco3.

Getting Binaries
--------------------

Binary distributions of the release 0.3.5 of Clafer Tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux, 
can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions). 

The binary for this project is called `claferchocoig-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

In case this binary does not work on your particular machine configuration, it can be built from source code, as described further.

Running
-------------

### Prerequisites

* [Java 6+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
* [Clafer Compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer). Required for compiling Clafer files (`.cfr`) into the Clafer Choco Javascript format (`.js`), so that they can be run using the tool.
 
### Running Standalone

First, use *Clafer Compiler*:

```sh
clafer --mode=choco <file-name.cfr>
```

This will convert the Clafer file (`.cfr`) into the Clafer Choco Javascript file (`.js`). 

Next, run the instance generator:

```sh
java -jar claferchocoig-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar <file-name.js>
```

This will run the solver and produce optimal instances in a textual form. Only Clafer files with single objective can be processed at this time. 

To get the tool version:

```sh
java -jar claferchocoig-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar --version
```

### Running as a Backend

* Install [ClaferIDE](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferIDE).
* Copy the binary `claferchocoig-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to the `Backends` folder. If you built the project from the source code, the binary can be found in the `target` subfolder.
* Put (if exists, just make sure all paths match) the following configuration in the `Server/Backends/backends.json` :

```json
{
    "backends": [
        ....
        , 
        {
            "id": "chocoIG", 
            "label": "Choco-based Instance Generator",
            "tooltip": "The new IG based on Choco3 solver library",
            "accepted_format": "choco",             
            "tool": "java",
            "tool_args": ["-jar", "$dirname$/claferchocoig-0.3-5-jar-with-dependencies.jar", "$filepath$"],            
            "tool_version_args": ["-jar", "$dirname$/claferchocoig-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar", "--version"],
            "scope_options": {
                "set_global_scope" : {"command": "globalScope $value$\n"}, 
                "set_int_scope" : {"command": "intScope $low$ $high$\n"},                 
                "set_individual_scope": {"command": "scope $clafer$ $value$\n"}, 
                "clafer_scope_list" : {"command": "saveScopes\n"}
            },
            "control_buttons": [
                {"id": "next", "command": "n\n", "label" : "Next", "tooltip": "Next Instance"}, 
                {"id": "reload", "command": "r\n", "label" : "Reload", "tooltip": "Reload the model"}, 
                {"id": "soo_mode", "command": "soo\n", "label" : "SOO Mode", "tooltip": "Switch to single-objective optimization mode and back"}, 
                {"id": "quit", "command": "q\n", "label" : "Quit", "tooltip": "Exit the IG safely"}
            ]            
        },
        ....        
    ]   
}

```
`$dirname$` means the full path to the *Server/Backends* folder, `$filepath$` is the full path to the input JS file being processed.
* If you made any changes to the `backends.json`, then restart *ClaferMooVisualizer*.
* Now the backend should be accessible in *ClaferIDE* and listed in the `Backends` dropdown list.

Building
--------

### Prerequisites

* [Maven 2+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Required for building the projects and linking all dependencies
* [ChocoSolver](https://github.com/gsdlab/chocosolver). This is a Maven dependency for the project, so it should be installed (`mvn install`) as well.

### Procedures

* Using Maven, run: `mvn install` over the project.
* Two binaries will appear in the `target` subfolder: `claferchocoig-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar` that is standalone and contains all the required dependencies, and `claferchocoig-0.3.5.jar` that is not.

### Important: Branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*. 
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development. 
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches `master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.
